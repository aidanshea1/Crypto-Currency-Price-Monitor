# Crypto-Currency-Price-Monitor
Using coinlayer's API, this program checks the price of a desired crypto currency and tells the user to buy or sell using a few exponential moving averages of varied widths that the user chooses.

The program will ask you for an API Key, a desired unit of time (enter in seconds) for each report of the price, and desired units for 3 exponential moving averages. 
In addition to outputting the price, the program will also output whether or not the user should buy or sell using the moving averages.
